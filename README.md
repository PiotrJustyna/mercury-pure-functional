## null checking

Here is the order in which the information flows and the types are constructed:

`xml -> WhoisRecord -> WhoisResponse`

Unlike C#, F# does not treat `null` as a first-class citizen. Presence or absence of values is usually preferred to be indicated using the `Option` type. However, when interfacing C# code, one should remember that values arriving from C# could be null. To handle such scenarios, I initially proposed null checking at the C# side, but there are better ways of achieving this and in the current version of the code, I propose to null check at the F# side.

To achieve this, our models are now divided into two categories:

* [records](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/records) - simple, ideally immutable F# models. In our case, records are used internally, in F#-F# interactions. Example:

  ```f#
  type WhoisResponse =
      {   Domain: string
          DomainAgeInDays: Option<float>
          DomainLastUpdatedInDays: Option<float>
          DomainExpirationInDays: Option<float>
          AuditCreated: Option<DateTime>
          AuditUpdated: Option<DateTime> }
  ```
  What is worth noting is that most fields in this record are of type `Option<T>`, which indicates that they could be missing (as they are mapped from a type which models our xml, and the xml is not guaranteed to be always correct).

* [classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/classes) - more complex, C#-like models, ideal for interfacing C# code. In our case, classes are used in C#-F# interactions, specifically to deserialize xml. Example:

  ```f#
  [<AllowNullLiteral>]
  type Audit() =
      member val createdDate = String.Empty with get, set
      member val updatedDate = String.Empty with get, set
  ```
  What becomes immediately obvious is:
  * parameterless constructor exposed
  * type is decorated with the `AllowNullLiteral` attribute indicating that its values can be `null` (problems with parsing, incorrectly defined xml, etc.)
  * properties (`createdDate`, `updatedDate`) defined explicitly and made mutable (`with get, set`) to be automatically set during deserialization.

All unit tests validating null checking are also done on the F# side.

## unit testing

This repository uses [xunit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit) + [unquote](https://github.com/SwensenSoftware/unquote).

The repository used to use [fsunit](https://fsprojects.github.io/FsUnit/) but unquote provides better:

* type checking strictness

  example (`differenceInDays` returns `float`):

    * fsunit:

        ```f#
        MercuryLibrary.BusinessLogic.differenceInDays start finish
        |> should equal -1
        ```
      
        The test passes even though `-1` and the value returned by `differenceInDays` are of different types.

  * unquote:

      ```f#
      test <@ MercuryLibrary.BusinessLogic.differenceInDays start finish = -1.0 @>
      ```

    The test passes provided that the `-1` is strictly represented as a `float` (`-1.0`, not `-1`), so that both compared values are of exactly the same type.

* error messages for failing tests
  
    sample failing test
